        of blocks, starting from the highest to the lowest. The middle entry is always the best so far. The number of

        being the best) is established. Once the golden ratio bracket is established, perform golden ratio search until
        the bracket is narrowed to consecutive number of blocks where the middle one is identified as the optimal
        number of blocks."""
